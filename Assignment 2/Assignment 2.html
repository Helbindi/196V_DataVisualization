  <h2>Dataset</h2>

  <p>
    DESCRIPTION: <br/>
    Ornithology student Mitch Vogel was immediately suspicious of the noxious gases just pouring out of the 
    smokestacks from the four manufacturing factories south of the nature preserve. He was almost certain that
    all of these companies are contributing to the downfall of the poor Rose-crested Blue Pipit bird. Mitch
    discovered that the state government has been monitoring the gaseous effluents from the factories through a
    set of sensors, distributed around the factories, and set between the smokestacks, the city of Mistford and
    the nature preserve. The state has given Mitch access to their air sampler data,meteorological data, and locations
    map. Use visual analytics to help Mitch determine which (if any) of the factories may be contributing to the
    problems of the Rose-crested Blue Pipit. I chose this data set because I was curious about what the other VAST
    challenge were like.

  <h2>Initial Analysis Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Characterize the sensorsâ€™ performance and operation. Are they all working properly at all
 	times? Can you detect any unexpected behaviors of the sensors through analyzing the readings
 	they capture?</li>
    <li>Which chemicals are being detected by the sensor group? What patterns of chemical releases do
	you see, as being reported in the data?</li>
    <li>Which factories are responsible for which chemical releases? Carefully describe how you determined
 	this using all the data you have available. For the factories you identified, describe any observed
 	patterns of operation revealed in the data.</li>

    <img src="April Sensor Reading.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    Sensor readings for the 15th day of April. Differences in reading value is shown by size and each chemical is given
    an individual color. 6AM, 9AM, and 9PM have different readings for the same chemical - one large reading and one smaller.
    Since I want to determine the severity of the chemical emission, I chose the larger value.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="August Sensor Reading.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    Sensor readings for the first week of August. Of the three data sets, August is the only month where the data does not start
    on the first day. The sensor readings for August begin on 8/4/2016 6:00PM. Why are there no sensor readings between
    8/1/2016 12:00AM and 8/4/2016 6:00PM?
    </p>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="How much.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    Summation of sensor readings for each individual sensor seperated by color based on the chemical type. The number of recorded
    readings for each chemical type is also labeled. Although all the sensors receive approximately the same amount of reports, there
    is a clear difference in the sum of the readings. This means that some senors are detections larger readings of chemicals than others. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Filtered Sensor Reading(bin).png" />
    <p class="caption">
    The sensor readings have placed in bins to show the number of occurrences for a specific reading range. For this dataset, I am looking
    for large emissions of chemicals detected by the sensors so I have filtered the data to only show readings above 5. From the image:
    High readings of AGOC-3A are detected from sensors 3-9.
    There are not many high readings of Appluimonia but the chemical is detected the most in sensor 9.
    High readings of Chlorodinine are mostly detected from sensor 6 with one instance in sensors 3 and 8.
    High readings of Methylosmolene is are mostly detected from sensor 3 and 6.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="April Sensor 8 Reading.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    This image shows the sensor 8 reading seperated by hour and chemical type for April. This image is also similar to the first above image
    where I asked why the sensors had two readings for AGOC-3A. On 4/15/2016 6AM and 9AM there are two readings of AGOC-3A, however there
    are no readings for Methylosmolene at the same time. There are Methylosmolene readings before and after that time frame but not during.
    There is a possibility that the sensor is not recording high readings of Methylosmolene properly and mistaking it for AGOC-3A in April.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="AugustDecember Sensor 6 Reading.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    This image shows the sensor 6 reading seperated by hour and chemical type for August and December. Like the previous image above, whenever
    there are two readings of AGOC-3A - there is no reading of Methylosmolene during the same time. This pattern accordings in multiple sensors
    in all three months. This makes the notion that there is an error in the sensor recordings less likely. The common occurence of this pattern
    suggests that the additional reading of AGOC-3A is intentional and infact this additional reading is actually the missing Methylosmolene reading.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="AGOC-3A.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    This map is generated by joining the sensor and meteorological data sets by date/time. Each arrow is pointing towards the direction the wind was
    originating from at the specific time. Using these arrows, it gives a general understanding where a chemical detected by a sensor originated from.
    From this image, it shows AGOC-3A chemical readings that are above 5 and the arrows themselves are scaled by the size of the reading to give better clarity.
    Sensors 3, 4, 5 are pointing towards the Fitness and Office factories but from sensor 6 we can assume that the Office factory is the main culprit
    for the AGOC-3A readings detected by its surrounding sensors. According to sensor 6, Radiance ColourTek also is emitting AGOC-3A chemicals. It is also
    important to note that based on the previous images, some of these AGOC-3A readings may actually be Methylosmolene readings.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Appluimonia.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    Based on sensor 3, the chemical emission of Appluimonia could be due to either the Fitness or Office factories. Unlike AGOC-3A, sensor 6 does not help
    us determine which of the two factories is the cause. The largest reading does come from sensor 6 - pointing towards Radiance ColourTek. Sensor 9
    also indicate that there is possible emissions from Indigo Sol Board. Overall, Appluimonia has the lowest readings found among the four chemicals. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Chlorodinine.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    Based on the image, there is only one facotry which seems to be generating high readings of Chlorodinine - Roadrunner Fitness Electronics. All the arrows
    from sensors 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 are indicating that this factory is the culprit.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Methylosmolene.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    Despite the data for Methylosmolene readings being changed to AGOC-3A (as shown in previous images above), there is still enough data to indicate a culprit. 
    Sensor 6 readings suggest that Kasios Office Furniture is the main cause of Methylosmolene emission. This assumption is further proven by the fact that
    AGOC-3A readings by sensor 6 also point towards Kasios as the main culprit. Kasios may be trying to mask their Methylosmolene emission as AGOC-3A.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
    In conclusion, the dataset for the sensors contain unexpected behaviors such as missing data or misrepresentation of chemical readings (multiple AGOC-3A readings).
    AGOC-3A emissions seem to be emitted by Kasios Office Furniture and Radiance ColourTek. Appluimonia emmisions seem to be emitted by Indigo Sol Board and Roadrunner
    Fitness Electronics. Chlorodinine emissions seem to be emitted by Roadrunner Fitness Electronics. Methylosmolene emissions seem to be emitted by Kasios Office Furniture.
    From this dataset, I learned that you need to dig deeper into the data because what the data presents to you at face value may not be the full story. For example, I was
    curious about the two readings of AGOC-3A but thought that the sensors were just detecting multiple readings because it was recording in three hour intervals. If I had
    not dug deeper into the data, I would have missed the pattern of missing data for Methylosmolene whenever there were two readings of AGOC-3A.
