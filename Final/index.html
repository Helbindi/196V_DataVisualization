  <h1>Final Project: Explanatory Narrative</h1>

  <h2>Dataset</h2>

  <p>
    MTGJSON is an open-source project that catalogs all Magic: The Gathering cards into a portable format.
    It is produced by a group of dedicated fans maintaining and supplying data from multiple sources and approved partners.
    Since quarantine started, I have been trying to get back into MTG since it has a free online platform (MTG Arena).
    MTG was first introduced in 1993, since then it has implemented and updated new rules and cards every year. There is
    a lot to process when first starting the game. I was curious whether visualizations created from this dataset could
    be useful to explaining the game.

    <br>There are over 20,000 unique cards in MTG, thus I am limited the dataset to the latest three sets in Standard
        because I am unfamiliar with the other formats and these three sets were released after I stopped playing, so I
        am interested in learning about them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The data is available online at:

  <h2>Initial Analysis Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Outside of the rules of the game, what factors about the game may confuse or overwhelm the players?</li>
    <li>When new cards are released, are they evenly distributed? Are the developers trying to promote diversity?</li>
    <li>I heard getting into MTG can be expensive. Is it possible to play without spending large amounts of money?</li>
  </ol>

      </summary>
      <h1>Planeswalker</h1>
      Planeswalkers represent powerful beings within the game world and thematically also represent identities of the player. As cards, Planeswalkers
      are played with an initial amount of loyalty counters which act as their in-game resource to survive or use their abilities.
      Playing a duplicate copy of a Planeswalker that is already on the board will destroy the initial one. Similar to the Legendary rule.

      </summary>

      <br><br>Common creature types: Birds, Kithkin, Wizards

      </summary>
      <h1>Blue-Black</h1>
      Blue-black is related to secrets and forbidden knowledge. Blue's emphasis on information and black's solitary nature combine to create a very secretive color pair. The opponents of Blue-Black decks often realize that they are going to lose when it is too late.

      </summary>
      <h1>Black-Red</h1>
      Black's anti-sociality and Red's hedonism combine to create a very sadistic and sociopathic color pair. Black-red decks typically prefer overwhelming opponents at all cost, often at the expense of their own creatures and even their users' life total.
      <br><br>Common mechanics: Haste, Wither, spells and creature that are undercosted but have drawbacks hurt the casters, sacrifice, direct damage/life loss, disallowing life gain, power boosting, +X/-X effects

      </summary>
      <h1>Red-Green</h1>
      Red-Green is very unthinking, considering the fact that it has red's impulsiveness and green's preference for instinct over the mind. Red-Green decks are typically highly aggressive and attempt to overwhelm their opponents with pure strength.
      <br><br>Common mechanics: Trample, Haste, Reach, Land Removal, Fight, +X/+X effects, Fast mana, one-sided fight (dealing damage equal to the power of a creature you control to an opponent's creature), direct damage to flying creatures, Aggressive creatures

      </summary>
      <h1>Green-White</h1>

      </summary>
      <h1>White-Black</h1>
      White-Black as a color can represent corruption or dishonesty under the clever veil of mercy and/or kindness. It may also represent the balance of good and evil, where the world is seen as a grey area in times of war or strife. As a mechanic, White-black is about gradually killing one's enemies, with white slowing the game down and black destroying opponent's creatures and draining their life totals.

      <br><br>Common mechanics: Lifelink, parasitism, life gain, return creatures from graveyard, massive removal, permanent exiling, extort

      <br>Looking at all three sets, The majority of cards are between CMC 2 and 4 regardless of color.

      <br><br>Boxplot: Prices among rarity types of a specific Standard set.
      <br>From the boxplot, it is clear that rarity plays a role a cards price. Amongst these different
          rarity, their prices are not the same for their rarity counterparts. Disregarding outliers,
          the prices of cards typically cluster into three groups: low, medium, high.
      <br><br>It is also shown that the majority of cards are actually in the low cost category. While they
          may not be as good as the other higher cost cards, they are playable on a leveled field.
          One such way is a special format called Pauper. It has the same rules such as deck size
          and copy limit but the cards in the deck must all be Common rarity. Also if the player is not playing
          in a competitive environment but with a small group, rules can be applied to deck building such
          as limiting the price of a total deck, no Mythic or Rare cards, or no cards over a specific price.
          This is a way to play MTG without worrying about the cost.

      <br>This is the price history of Lurrus of the Dream Den from the Theros Beyond Death set.
          This card cost twice as much as other rare cards in the same set. On April 18th,
          The price was around the same as the other rare cards but by the 20th, the card now cost
          twice as much. The reason is due to demand - after the 18th, people started to realized
          the potential and strengths of this card as shown in the increased appearances of a deck
          featuring this card called Rakdos Lurrus in a MTG Tournaments.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      For new players, they can be overwhelmed by the amount of card types and color combinations and how they work.
      Not only just learning about the cards but there is also the challenge (and fun) in making their own deck.
      Players need to consider what card and how many of them to add into their decks. Players are given a large amount
      of freedom in how their decks turn out. Each set introduces around 300 new cards where all types of cards and colors
      are represented. This also applies to how they play their decks in-game. A large majority of the cards are below 4 CMC.
      Thus, players are allowed to have multiple options in what types of cards they and their opponent can play early on in a game.
      There are cards that are very expensive but there are also cards that are extremely cheap in comparison. Although the
      cheaper cards may not be as good as the expensive ones, there are a lot of ways to incorporate rules or formats where
      using cheaper cards can be just as fun and engaging as expensive ones. As a result, people can enjoy playing MTG without
      having to worry about the cost.
